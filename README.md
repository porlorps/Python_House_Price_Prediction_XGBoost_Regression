# Python House Price Prediction XGBoost Regression

This analytics project is aim to build the regression model using XGBoost algorithm for predicting the house price. This projects is part of House Price Competition from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

This analytics project is aim to build regression model to predict house price by using historical house price data. The model will use XGBoost regression algorithm to conduct the prediction model which will go through stages of data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation and lastly, predict the unseen data.
